# Library Reference

Welcome to the *phoenix* reference documentation. This page contains information about how to use *phoenix*, a
C++-library for parsing file formats used by the *ZenGin*, an early 2000's game engine developed by
[Piranha Bytes](https://www.piranha-bytes.com/) for the
games [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game))
and [Gothic II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game)).

If you are new to *phoenix*, a good place to start is [Getting Started](quickstart.md). If you are looking
for information about a specific file type, the [File Type Reference](reference.md) might be the place you're
looking for.
